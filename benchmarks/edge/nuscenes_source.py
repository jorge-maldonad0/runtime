"""nuScenes manifest source.

Reads the frozen nuScenes v1.0 metadata via the official devkit and yields one
manifest row per keyframe (sample) in the schema shared with the KITTI source:

    {scene_id, frame_id, lidar_path, gt_path}

GT treatment differs from KITTI by necessity. KITTI has a per-frame label file
(label_2/NNNNNN.txt); nuScenes keeps every box for the whole dataset in a single
table, sample_annotation.json. So instead of a per-frame path we do:

  * frame_id embeds the SAMPLE TOKEN. Downstream code recovers a frame's boxes
    by filtering sample_annotation.json on sample_token == <that token>.
  * gt_path points at that one shared sample_annotation.json. It is therefore
    IDENTICAL for every nuScenes row (still a non-empty string, so it passes
    build_manifest's per-field validation).

The version is NOT hardcoded: it is read from GITM_NUSCENES_VERSION at call
time (e.g. "v1.0-mini" for early iteration, "v1.0-trainval" later). Both mini
and trainval carry real annotations and back a valid gt_path; only v1.0-test
ships an empty sample_annotation.json, so test cannot back a gt_path.

Paths in each row are RELATIVE to GITM_DATA_ROOT so the manifest is portable
across machines (local dev box, GPU box, Friday clean-box re-run).

This module ONLY yields rows. It does not download, does not write the JSONL,
and does not compute hashes. A separate orchestrator consumes iter_rows() and
writes the manifest; a separate script handles input hashing.

NOTE: unlike the streaming JSONL writer (which keeps memory flat), the nuScenes
devkit loads all metadata tables into RAM for the duration of iter_rows() --
notably sample_annotation (~1.4M rows). That is the cost of using the devkit.
