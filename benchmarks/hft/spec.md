# HFT benchmark — spec

> Owner: Ash — baseline + profiling + spec doc.

## 1. Input definition
Synthetic limit-order-book stream at 1×10⁹ events per seed, Parquet
(row-group 128 MiB, zstd-1), schema in [datasets.md](datasets.md). Bytes live in
`$GITM_S3_ROOT/datasets/hft/hft_1b_seed{42,43,44}/`, frozen by
[manifest.yaml](manifest.yaml).

## 2. Work unit
One million events end-to-end through:
`ingest → order-book update → top-of-book snapshot → derived metric
(microprice + VWAP-1s window)`. Baseline harness: a CUDA kernel set plus a
host-side Arrow ingest pipeline. Phases above are the rows of the stall table.
<!-- TODO: pin harness commit + config hash. -->

## 3. Success metric
`events_per_second` over a 60 s warm window. **Baseline target: ≥ 25 M events/s
on a single A100.** Three seeds must agree within 2 % (the recorded baseline is
their mean). No auxiliary metrics.

## 4. Expected stall profile
Matches `[expected_stall]` in [bench.toml](bench.toml):

| | CPU | Data-stall | Sync | GPU active |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Expected | < 5 % | 10–25 % | 5–15 % | 60–80 % |

Data-stall is Parquet decode + host→device copy; sync is top-of-book
reductions; CPU is low because Arrow handles ingest off the hot path.

**Saturation rule:** if measured GPU active > 85 %, flag Adit same day — fall
back to a 500 M-event shard and document.
