The three invariants live in different units:

kernel-time residual: dimensionless fraction of time (+0.3 = 30% slower than predicted)
memory-traffic residual: dimensionless fraction of bytes (+0.3 = 30% more traffic than predicted)
stream-concurrency residual: fraction of kernels that serialized when they shouldn't have
