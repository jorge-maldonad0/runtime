"""Multi-basis anomaly confirmation (GITM-008).

A single large residual is a weak signal — measurement noise, a one-off
scheduler hiccup, or a genuine deviation all look the same in raw position
space. The multi-basis filter requires an anomaly to be confirmed in **two or
more independent bases** before the deviation monitor emits a violation, which
cuts the false-positive rate that would otherwise flood causal attribution.

Two bases here:

* **sequence-position (identity)** — a robust z-score on the residual at its
  position. Catches a value that stands out against the per-op distribution.
* **frequency-domain** — subtract a low-pass (smooth-trend) reconstruction via
  rFFT and z-score the high-frequency remainder. Catches a *localized spike*
  while ignoring slow drift that the position basis would also flag.

A residual is confirmed only if both bases flag it. Series too short for a
meaningful spectrum fall back to the position basis alone (documented, not
silent) so short traces still get detection.
