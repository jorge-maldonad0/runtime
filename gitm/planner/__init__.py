"""Behavioral Compiler — emits a predicted execution graph.

This is the **predicted** half of the residual equation. Roofline-based
per-operation predictions: max of compute-bound and memory-bound time.
GQA-aware for decode. Wrong in detail, right in shape — residuals isolate
the optimization-worthy kernels.
