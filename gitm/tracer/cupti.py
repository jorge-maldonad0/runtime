"""CUPTI backend — per-kernel activity ingestion.

Wraps the native CUPTI shim (:mod:`gitm.tracer._cupti`) behind the tracer
backend interface that :func:`gitm.tracer.capture.capture` expects. On
``start()`` CUPTI activity collection is enabled; on ``stop()`` the buffers are
flushed and the raw record dicts are decoded into validated
:class:`~gitm.tracer.schema.TraceEvent` objects by :mod:`gitm.tracer._cupti_decode`.

Construction raises ``RuntimeError`` if the compiled shim is absent (CPU-only
host, or a GPU box where ``python -m gitm.tracer._cupti.build`` hasn't run), so
``capture`` falls back to a well-formed no-op trace rather than failing. The
heavy lifting and all unsafe struct handling live in the C shim; everything in
this module is ordinary Python.
